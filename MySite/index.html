     I’m Ela, born and raised in Los Angeles, studying Music Technology in my fourth year at CalArts.
  </p>
<h2 id="AboutMe"> About Me </h2> 
  <p> As I get closer to graduating from CalArts, I’m starting to see the outcomes of expectations I had at the beginning of my time here. I  <em> really </em> thought I would graduate with <b> a lot </b> more musical work. However, I got into game development instead, which is odd because I really sucked at coding, hated it, and it never made sense to me. So, for the image that represents me I used the Hero Cycle because that's the journey I feel I've been on artistically and especially with coding. </p>
